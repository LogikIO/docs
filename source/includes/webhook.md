# Webhooks
Webhooks are "user defined HTTP callbacks".

With Stamplay, Webhooks can be used as custom event triggers for 3rd-Party Integrations, Code Blocks, or Core Services.

## Creating Webhooks

To create a webhook, visit the Stamplay Editor for the application you would like to add a webhook for.

Navigate to the **Webhooks** section, enter a name for your Webhook and **Create**.
